We are working on the RIPHI Data for Open Door Health.

Our goals are to answer the following research questions subject to change:

- What is the association between income level and frequency/severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7 scores)?

- How does income level correlate with food insecurity (e.g., skipping meals, inability to afford balanced meals)?

- Are lower-income patients less likely to have been tested for STIs or HIV in the past year?

- Does knowing someone who overdosed increase the likelihood of accepting free Naloxone?
